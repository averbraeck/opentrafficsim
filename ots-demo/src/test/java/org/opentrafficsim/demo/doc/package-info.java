/**
 * This package contains code that can be found in the documentation. When changes are made here due to changes in the
 * underlying OTS code, this means the documentation needs to be updated. Each class, method, or group of lines should report
 * where in the documentation it can be found. Similar comment lines can also be found in the underlying OTS code. Example
 * comments are:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // @docs/08-tutorials/simulation-setup.md#how-to-set-up-a-simulation
 * </pre>
 * 
 * To indicate the end of a few lines of code, when relevant, use:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // @end
 * </pre>
 * 
 * An additional instruction / comment may be given between parenthesis:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // @docs/06-behavior/parameters.md (without throws)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Sometimes the code is built in parts in the documentation. For example first a class definition, after which separate method
 * implementations are presented. It is sufficient to tell at the class level where the class definition is, and then to have
 * separate location comments for methods individually presented. As this is all demo code, comments in any other form may be
 * omitted.
