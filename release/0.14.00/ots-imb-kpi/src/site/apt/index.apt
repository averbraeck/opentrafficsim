OTS - Open Traffic Simulation

	OpenTrafficSim aims to bring traffic simulation to a new level:

    * OpenTrafficSim combines micro-simulation, macro-simulation and meta-simulation in a single environment.

    * OpenTrafficSim combines all traffic modes (private cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, airlines, etc.) in a single simulator.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, discrete-event
      and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..

======

	OTS-IMB-KPI is the Open Traffic Simulation module for the calculation of Key Performance Indicators on the basis of information
	received on the IMB bus. The resulting KPIs will also be published again on the IMB bus.
	
	* OTS-IMB-KPI can be linked over IMB to multiple simulation packages, as long as they can publish t/x information on lanes.
	
	* OTS-IMB-KPI can sample over different time intervals and different space regions.
	
	* OTS-IMB-KPI can use metadata to filter results.
	
	* OTS-IMB-KPI calculates indicators like mean speed, total delay and number of stops based on solid scientific principles.
	
	* OTS-IMB-KPI can publish the resulting indicators on the IMB bus.

	OpenTrafficSim has an open source BSD 3-clause license.

    * Third party components used in OpenTrafficSim can not have a license that is more restrictive than BSD, Apache, MIT, LGPL, Eclipse.

    * OpenTrafficSim can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for any use (educational, commercial, whatever).

    * OpenTrafficSim may be extended, evolved by anyone into anything else for any purpose.
