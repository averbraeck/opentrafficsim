OTS - Open Traffic Simulation Swing-based drawing classes.

	The ots-draw project provides classes to draw on a AWT Graphics2D canvas. The classes can be used for ots-swing
	and ots-web. The latter uses a virtual Graphics2D canvas. The main components are:  

    * generic classes to draw lines, shapes, polygons and text.

    * classes to make traffic-relevant plots.
    
    * classes to draw cars and car generators.
    
    * classes to draw lane structures.
    
    * classes to draw network components (links, nodes).
    
    * classes to draw static objects.
    
    * classes to draw road-specific structures such as lanes, shoulders, stripes, speed signs, sensors, and traffic lights.
