OTS - Open Traffic Simulation Web-based GUI classes.

	The ots-web project provides classes to run simulation models on the Web using HTML5. It heavily builds on the dsol-web project
	that already provides all major classes to control and run simulations and animations on the Web. The main components are:  

    * GUI components for animation.
    
    * GUI components for graphs.
