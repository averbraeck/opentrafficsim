OTS - Open Traffic Simulation generic animation classes.

	The ots-animation project provides lightweight classes for animation, that are not dependent on any solution. 
	They can be used with Swing, Web-based solutions, JavaFX, or external graphical packages. The main components are:  

    * generic shape information that can be used in e.g., parsers.

    * colorers for GTUs and network structures, which provide generic color information and the conditions under which color will change.
    
    * coordinate transform methods for GIS.
