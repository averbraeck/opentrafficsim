OTS - Open Traffic Simulation Web-based XML Schema parsing classes.

	The ots-xsd project provides classes to parse XML files. Parsing uses auto-generated JAXB classes. Bindings and 
	adapters are available to provide seamless mappings between the generated Java classes and the classes in the 
	other OTS projects. The project has been built in such a way, however, that the ots-xsd project is not dependent on
	other ots projects. Intermediate classes are used when necessary. The main components are:  

	* xsd definitions for ots.
	
	* bindings.xsd making the link between the tags and the adapter classes.
	
    * Generated classes using the JAXB protocol.
    
    * Binding adapter classes to do transformations.
