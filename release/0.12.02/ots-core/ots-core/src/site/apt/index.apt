OTS - Open Traffic Simulation

	OpenTrafficSim aims to bring traffic simulation to a new level:

    * OpenTrafficSim combines micro-simulation, macro-simulation and meta-simulation in a single environment.

    * OpenTrafficSim combines all traffic modes (private cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, airlines, etc.) in a single simulator.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, discrete-event
      and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..

======

	OTS-CORE contains the core classes for the OpenTrafficSim project.
	
	* OTS-CORE takes care of network structure, general movement of objects, storage of routes, use of the DSOL simulator, etc..
	
	* OTS-CORE provides base classes for modeling networks.
	
	* OTS-CORE provides base classes for modeling GTUs (General Travel Units), i.e. the objects that move on the network.
	
	* OTS-CORE provides base classes for modeling routes.
	
	* OTS-CORE provides base classes for defining the geometry of the network.
	
	* OTS-CORE provides base classes for simulation using DSOL.
	
	* OTS-CORE provides base classes for animation using DSOL.
