/**
 * Strategical planners. A strategicalPlanner is the planner responsible for the overall 'mission' of the GTU, usually
 * indicating where it needs to go. It operates by instantiating tactical planners to do the actual work, which is generating
 * operational plans (paths over time) to follow to reach the destination that the strategical plan is aware of.
