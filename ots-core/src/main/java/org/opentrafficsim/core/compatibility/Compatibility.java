/**
 * Compatibility of infrastructure and users of that infrastructure. Examples are compatibility of a GtuType with a LinkType, or
 * GtuType with a LaneType, or GtuType with a SensorType. Both infrastructure type and user type are hierarchical, and the
 * information to make the decision might be higher up in the hierarchy. The outcome depends on whether the infrastructure or
 * the user hierarchy is traversed first. Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Infrastructure: Road, Highway is-a Road
 * User:           Vehicle, Car is-a Vehicle, SlowVehicle is-a Vehicle, Bicycle is-a SlowVehicle.
 * Compatibility:  (Road, Vehicle) = True, (Highway, SlowVehicle) = False
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Suppose we want to know the compatibility between Bicycle and Highway. The compatibility (Highway, Bicycle) is not defined.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Infra first: When we examine infrastructure first, we go up the infra hierarchy to Road. (Road, Bicycle) is not given.
 * Now move up Bicycle. (Road, SlowVehicle) is not provided. Move up. (Road, Vehicle) is provided and True. So, Bicycle is
 * allowed on Highway</li>
 * <li>user first: we go up the user hierarchy to SlowVehicle. (Highway, SlowVehicle) is defined and False. So, Bicycle is NOT
 * allowed on Highway</li>
 * </ul>
 * To avoid such problems, a very strict definition of what comes "first" has to be provided. The way this is implemented is as
 * follows: First, all combinations in the two hierarchies will be searched for explicitly forbidden combinations. If there is a
 * forbidden combination, compatibility is false. If the compatibility is not explicitly false, the hierarchies will be checked
 * to look for an explicit compatibility that is true. If there is any, the result is true. If nothing is specified in the
 * hierarchies (neither true nor false), the compatibility is false.
