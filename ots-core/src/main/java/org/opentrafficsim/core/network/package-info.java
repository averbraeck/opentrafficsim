/**
 * Classes that build a network with nodes, links, and cross-sections.
 * <p>
 * The network classes are independent of the type of vehicle (GTU) that is used. Specific subclasses for roads, rail, shipping
 * lanes, or planes should be added to sub-packages with names like road, rail, ship, pedestrians, and air. <br>
 * Geometry classes can be added for animation, as well as a detailed cross-section of the links on the network (see the lane
 * sub-package).
