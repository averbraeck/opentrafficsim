Sim0MQ Message Bus for Java

	The Sim0MQ message bus is a fast messaging protocol to create loosely coupled simulations.

    * Sim0MQ uses the 0MQ protocol as its basis, enabling up to 2 million messages per second.

    * Sim0MQ provides low-level binary messages for fast message exchange.
    
    * Sim0MQ provides structured binary messages for more controlled message exchange.
    
    * Sim0MQ will be enabled with an IDL-type feature to generate message stubs automatically.
    
    * Sim0MQ can be used with any language that 0MQ supports: Java, C, C++, C#, Python, and a few dozen  more. 
    
    * Sim0MQ works in a brokerless fashion due to the nature of the underlying 0MQ protocol.
    
    * Sim0MQ uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
      
    * Sim0MQ can be linked to DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, 
      discrete-event and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..

======

	Sim0MQ has an open source BSD 3-clause license.

    * Third party components used in OpenTrafficSim can not have a license that is more restrictive than BSD, Apache, MIT, LGPL, Eclipse.

    * Sim0MQ can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for any use (educational, commercial, whatever).

    * Sim0MQ may be extended, evolved by anyone into anything else for any purpose.
