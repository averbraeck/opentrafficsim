OTS - Open Traffic Simulation

	Sim0MQ makes use of the Ã˜MQ (or 0MQ or ZMQ) message bus, and contains a layer of simulation-specific components and messages 
	to aid in creating distributed simulation execution. 

    * Sim0MQ is built on top of the fast and extendible 0MQ message bus.

    * Sim0MQ builds on top of DJUNITS and DSOL, but can be used for any federated simulation.
    
    * Sim0MQ uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
      
    * Sim0MQ uses DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, discrete-event
      and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..
    
    * Sim0MQ has prototype implementations for Federation Managers and Federate Starters, helping with the development of
      large-scale distributed simulations using many cores and/or many computers.

======

	Sim0MQ has an open source BSD 3-clause license.

    * Third party components used in Sim0MQ can not have a license that is more restrictive than BSD, Apache, MIT, LGPL, Eclipse.

    * Sim0MQ can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for any use (educational, commercial, whatever).

    * Sim0MQ may be extended, evolved by anyone into anything else for any purpose.
