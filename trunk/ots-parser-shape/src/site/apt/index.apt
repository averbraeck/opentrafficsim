OTS - Open Traffic Simulation

	OpenTrafficSim aims to bring traffic simulation to a new level:

    * OpenTrafficSim combines micro-simulation, macro-simulation and meta-simulation in a single environment.

    * OpenTrafficSim combines all traffic modes (private cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, airlines, etc.) in a single simulator.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, discrete-event
      and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..

======

	OTS-PARSER-SHAPE is the Open Traffic Simulation module for parsing different types of ESRI shape files to be used in OTS.
	
	* OTS-PARSER-SHAPE is currently built on top of the OTS-ROAD module that takes care of network structure, general movement of GTUs, 
	  storage of routes, use of the DSOL simulator, etc..
	
	* OTS-PARSER-SHAPE reads a basic network structure from ESRI shape files into OTS, which can be further edited and enhanced.
	
	* OTS-PARSER-SHAPE currently has functionality for shape files as used in The Netherlands.
