        multi-screen aware.

1.0.9 : (23-Mar-2007) Serialization fix in TextFragment.

1.0.8 : (11-Dec-2006) Minor bugfixes in the synchronization of the Booting code
        and the FastStack.

1.0.7 : (03-Dec-2006) Cosmetic fixes for the logging of the PackageManager,
        ObjectTable implementation allows faster cloning of its contents,
        minor improvements to the GUI classes.

1.0.6 : (26-Sep-2006) BugFixes in the TextLayoutUtilities, SpreadSheetDate and
        ResourceBundleSupport classes.

1.0.5 : (29-Jun-2006) BugFixes in the boot code (synchronization added) and
        WaitingImageObserver (possible deadlock fixed). ObjectUtilities
		did not handle all cases where a ClassLoader could be null.

1.0.4 : (30-Apr-2006) Date- and NumberCellRenderer did not handle null-values
        properly.

1.0.3 : (17-Apr-2006) More improvements in the boot process for dependent
        library hierarchies.

1.0.1 : (10-Feb-2006) This release adds new boot capabilities and fixes
        some bugs in the XML classes. This version is required for
        JFreeReport and it is fully backward compatible with the 1.0.x
        branch.

1.0.0 : (14-Nov-2005) This is the official 1.0.0 release.  All future
        releases in the 1.0.x series will maintain backward compatibility
        with the 1.0.0 API.

1.0.0-rc1 : (01-Jun-2005) : Update to coincide with JFreeReport 0.8.5-5.
        JavaDoc update and classloader handling changed.

1.0.0-pre3 : (15-Apr-2005) : Some minor changes in the ResourceBundleSupport
        to allow the explicit definition of a locale.

1.0.0-pre2 : (04-Mar-2005) : Update to coincide with JFreeReport 0.8.5.
        Separated the xml-support packages into an own jar file.
        JFreeChart does not use these classes (except in experimental
        non-release code). Therefore, JFreeChart needs both libs to
        build, but only the jcommon.jar library to run.

        The a more detailed list of changed please have a look at the
        CHANGELOG.txt file.

1.0.0-pre1 : (29-Nov-2004) : Update to coincide with JFreeChart 1.0.0-pre1.
