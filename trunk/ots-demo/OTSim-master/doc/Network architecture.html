<title>Architecture of the Network and environment</title>

<h1>Network design</h1>
Open Traffic intends to provide a network architecture that is "model free". 
Instead of applying specific model design, we adhere to internationally accepted Open GIS Standards.
 
<h2>Overview of the road network</h2>
The network of roads is built-up from links and nodes. This enables the use of many path finding algorithms. 
To use the network for all types of assignments, the network design enables a further specification of this network.
The road includes one or more cross section objects. The longitudinal position is defined as its relative distance from the beginning of a link. 
Every link should have at least one cross section at the beginning of the link. Cross sections describe a cross cut of the road through cross section elements: these are for instance grass, a hard shoulder lane, a barrier and a median.
every cross section element may be further detailed. every cross section element includes information on its geometry: 
its lateral position from the centreline of the link. The cross section element type Road may include several objects. 
These extend the ""CrossSectionObject"", characterised by its topology such as a lateral and longitudinal position:
<ol>
<li>The road marking along: defines the lanes and rules for lane changing</li>
<li>Turn arrow: the allowed movements</li>
<li>Stop line: before the entrance of a junction</li>
<li>Priority sign: priority or give-way (yield)</li>
<li>Restrictions: defines the vehicles that may use the lane</li>
</ol> 
<h3>Junction</h2>
In Open Traffic, a junction can basically be defined as a node with its entering and leaving links. Every link requires a defintion of its cross section. 
If no further information is provided, the program creates a junction while using the geometry of the connecting links. 
To create junction movements, Open Traffic expands them by creating additional nodes at the end 
of very entering arm and the beginning of every leaving arm. 
Between these nodes, new links are created that define all possible movements at a junction.  
If no information is provided, all possible turns (excluding U-turns) are created within Open Traffic by some simple rules, 
generating a first proposal for the turning movements.
If, for instance an incoming arm has two lanes, and there are three leaving arms, the right lane allows for a right turn and straight forward. 
The left lane only allows left turning movements. After this conversion, banned turns may be included by using the graphical editor.
For that purpose the TurnArrow object can be used. It enables the definition of the allowed movements. Every incoming lane may have a turn arrow object. 
This TurnArrow object defines which leaving links are connected to this incoming lane. 
This is coded by numbering the outgoing links in anti-clockwise order, relatively to the incoming link (exit link 1, 2, 3 etc.). 
If an outgoing link has more than one lane, Open Traffic again provides a logical lane suggestion. 
Again, this may be changed later on by the graphical editor.
