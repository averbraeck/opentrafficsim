	<H2>IDM-plus car following model</H2>
	<p>In traffic flow modeling, the intelligent driver model (IDM) is
		a time-continuous car-following model for the simulation of freeway
		and urban traffic. It was developed by Treiber, Hennecke and Helbing
		in 2000 (Treiber, Martin; Hennecke, Ansgar; Helbing, Dirk (2000),
		"Congested traffic states in empirical observations and microscopic
		simulations", Physical Review E 62 (2): 1805–1824,
		doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.62.1805) to improve upon results provided with
		other "intelligent" driver models such as Gipps' Model, which lose
		realistic properties in the deterministic limit (Wikipedia).</p>

		From <a
			href="http://www.vwi.tu-dresden.de/~treiber/MicroApplet/IDM.html">http://www.vwi.tu-dresden.de/~treiber/MicroApplet/IDM.html</a>The
		IDM is an microscopic traffic flow model, i.e., each vehicle-driver
		combination constitutes an active "particle" in the simulation. Such
		model characterize the traffic state at any given time by the
		positions and speeds of all simulated vehicles. In case of multi-lane
		traffic, the lane index complements the state description. More
		specifically, the IDM is a car-following model. In such models, the
		decision of any driver to accelerate or to brake depends only on his
		or her own speed, and on the position and speed of the "leading
		vehicle" immediately ahead. Lane-changing decisions, however, depend
		on all neighboring vehicles (see the lane-changing model MOBIL). The
		model structure of the IDM can be described as follows: The
		influencing factors (model input) are the own speed v, the
		bumper-to-bumper gap s to the leading vehicle, and the relative speed
		(speed difference) Delta v of the two vehicles (positive when
		approaching). The model output is the acceleration dv/dt chosen by the
		driver for this situation. The model parameters describe the driving
		style, i.e., whether the simulated driver drives slow or fast, careful
		or reckless, and so on.
