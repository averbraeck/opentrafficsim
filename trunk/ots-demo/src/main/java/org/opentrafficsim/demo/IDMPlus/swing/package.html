	<H2>Integrated Lane Change Model with Relaxation and Synchronization (LRMS)</H2>
	<p>Wouter J. Schakel, Victor L. Knoop and Bart van Arem</p>
	<p>A proposed lane change model can be integrated with a car-following model 
	to form a complete microscopic driver model. The model resembles traffic 
	better at a macroscopic level, especially regarding the amount of traffic 
	volume per lane, the traffic speeds in different lanes, and the onset of 
	congestion. In a new approach, lane change incentives are combined for 
	determining a lane change desire. Included incentives are to follow a route, 
	to gain speed, and to keep right. Classification of lane changes is based on 
	behavior that depends on the level of lane change desire. Integration with a 
	car-following model is achieved by influencing car-following behavior for 
	relaxation and synchronization, that is, following vehicles in adjacent 
	lanes. Other improvements of the model are trade-offs between lane change 
	incentives and the use of anticipation speed for the speed gain incentive. 
	Although all these effects are captured, the lane change model has only 
	seven parameters. Loop detector data were used to validate and calibrate 
	the model, and an accurate representation of lane distribution and the 
	onset of congestion was shown.</p>
