OTS - Open Traffic Simulation

	OpenTrafficSim aims to bring traffic simulation to a new level:

    * OpenTrafficSim combines micro-simulation, macro-simulation and meta-simulation in a single environment.

    * OpenTrafficSim combines all traffic modes (private cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, airlines, etc.) in a single simulator.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, discrete-event
      and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..

======

	OTS-PARSER-XML is the Open Traffic Simulation module for parsing native XML networks for road-based transport.
	
	* OTS-PARSER-XML is built on top of the OTS-ROAD module that takes care of network structure, general movement of GTUs, 
	  storage of routes, use of the DSOL simulator, etc..
	
	* OTS-PARSER-XML reads a basic network structure from native XML-files into OTS, which can be further edited and enhanced.
	
	* The format of the OTS-PARSER-XML files is kept up-to-date with the developments of OTS, so test networks can be easily built.

	OpenTrafficSim has an open source BSD 3-clause license.

    * Third party components used in OpenTrafficSim can not have a license that is more restrictive than BSD, Apache, MIT, LGPL, Eclipse.

    * OpenTrafficSim can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for any use (educational, commercial, whatever).

    * OpenTrafficSim may be extended, evolved by anyone into anything else for any purpose.
