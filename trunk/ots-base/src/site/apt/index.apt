OTS - Open Traffic Simulation

	OpenTrafficSim aims to bring traffic simulation to a new level:

    * OpenTrafficSim combines micro-simulation, macro-simulation and meta-simulation in a single environment.

    * OpenTrafficSim combines all traffic modes (private cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, barges, etc.) in a single simulator.
    
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DJUNITS for a strongly typed unit system for values. A length scalar cannot be added to a time scalar; if 
      length is divided by time, a speed variable results. This is all checked at compile time rather than at run time.
      
    * OpenTrafficSim uses DSOL as the underlying, powerful simulation platform. DSOL takes care of time advance mechanisms, discrete-event
      and continuous simulation, random streams, probability distribution functions, experiment management, etc..
