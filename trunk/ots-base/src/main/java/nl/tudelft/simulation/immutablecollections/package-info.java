/**
 * Contains a set of immutable collection interfaces and wrapper implementations. Two versions of immutable collections are
 * implemented:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A version, identified by Immutable.COPY, where the immutable collection can neither be changed by any object "using" the
 * ImmutableCollection nor anymore by objects that have a pointer to the collection, as an internal (shallow) copy is made of
 * the collection. This is the <b>default</b> implementation.</li>
 * <li>A version, identified by Immutable.WRAP, where the immutable collection can not be changed by any object "using" the
 * ImmutableCollection, but it can still be changed by any object that has a pointer to the original collection that is
 * "wrapped". Instead of a (shallow) copy of the collection, a pointer to the collection is stored.</li>
 * </ol>
