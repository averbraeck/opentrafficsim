<title>Problems in OpenTraffic</title>

<h1>Problems in OpenTraffic</h1>
As the aim is to go Open Source in June 2013, it is important that most of the
currently known problems in OpenTraffic are fixed by that time. 
<h2>Dead code</h2>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2>Lots of half-cocked class files</h2>
<ul>
<li>Model/Settings.java do we really need a separate class for this? GT: I think 
it would be nice to have a kind of project file with settings / files etc.</li>
<li>Model/SimulationSettings.java    GT: perhaps delete or make Simulator specific</li>
<li>ShortestPathAlgorithms/DijkstraAlgorithm method getPathNodesBytes uses weird constants: TODO Guus</li>
<li>Simulators.RoadwaySimulator does not have a way to specify vehicle source and sinks</li>
<li>Testing/TestNetwork.java does not appear to test any part of OpenTraffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Duplicated code, highly similar code or highly similar functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>GUI/FileDialog.java vs ModelIO/FileChooser.java</li>
<li>GUI/FileIO/WriteDataNetwork.java creates (yet another) file chooser instead of re-using one of the existing ones</li>
<li>ModelIO/ImportModelShapeWizard.java creates (yet another) file chooser instead of re-using one of the existing ones</li>
<li>ModelIO/LoadModel.java creates (yet another) file chooser</li>
<li>ModelIO/SaveModel.java creates (yet another) file chooser</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poor user interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>GUI/ObjectInspector.java triple click to edit a node is non-intuitive, 
having to select another node to commit a change is also not intuitive</li>
<li>ModelIO/FileChooser.java very non-intuitive and requiring many more mouse clicks than it should</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage rights problems with borrowed code</h2>
<ul>
<li>GUI/StatusBar.java has Apache license V2.0; this is compatible with GPL V3;
but the source should be credited.</li>
<li>ModelIO/TableImport.java looks like it was stolen, but source is not credited</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved design</h2>
The CrossSectionElement class had ArrayLists for road markings, turning arrows 
and roadMarkerAlongIDs. This was overkill.
Especially since some of these are never used, created, written, or drawn. This
has been replaced by one ArrayList of CrossSectionObject.
<br />
What visual (and non-visual) objects could (and probably should) be embedded in a CrossSectionElement?
<ul>
<li>Solid lines (in the driving direction, entire longitudinal range, fixed lateral position)</li>
<li>Dashed lines (in the driving direction, repeating over entire longitudinal range, fixed lateral position)</li>
<li>Stop lines (perpendicular to the driving direction, full lateral range)</li>
<li>Turning arrows (repeated in the driving direction, fixed lateral position)</li>
<li>Speed limit reminders (repeated in the driving direction, fixed lateral position)</li>
<li>User class restrictions (e.g. BUS and bicycle lanes), (repeated in the driving direction, fixed lateral position)</li>
<li>Traffic detectors (specific longitudinal and lateral position and size)</li>
<li>Traffic lights (specific longitudinal position, full lateral range)</li>
<li>Speed bumps (usually not repeated; specific longitudinal position, full lateral range)</li>
<li>Pedestrian crossings (specific longitudinal position, longitudinal length, full lateral range)</li>
<li>Lanes (in the driving direction, full longitudinal range, fixed lateral position and width)</li>
</ul>
Repeating markings have a repeat distance/gap/frequency and an initial gap/phase.
<br />
Solid and dashed lines might have their lateral position defined with respect to either the right or the left edge of the CrossSectionEleement.
This is useful at lane drops, etc. 
<h2>Poor information hiding</h2>
Lots of classes have getters and setters for a complete ArrayList of some
set of objects that is stored inside the class. Examples are
<ul>
<li>setRoadMarkersAlongList and getRoadMarkersAlongList in CrossSectionElement</li>
<li>setTurnArrowList and  getTurnArrowList in CrossSectionElement</li>
<li>setCrossSectionElementList_w and getCrossSectionElementList_r in CrossSection</li>
<li>setParkingLots_w and getParkingLots_r in Building</li>
</ul>
There are many more. The problem with this is that the integrity and 
consistency of the contained list cannot be guarded by the class. Information
hiding should not be practiced in excess, but the current state of the source
code defeats many of the reasons for using classes.
<h1>Features that must work when we go Open Source</h1>
There should be a usable product when we go Open Source. At the very minimum
there should be:
<ul>
<li>A working micro-simulator. This will be MOTUS.</li>
<li>Traffic detectors that can report occupancy, speed and the number of passed
vehicles to be used to produce graphs of flow, speed, follow distance, etc.
The current implementation of detectors in MOTUS does not quite what we want,
but it should be easy to adapt.)</li>
<li>An interface with a traffic control program. This will be TrafCOD.
This requires traffic lights and traffic detectors that can report occupancy.
The MOTUS simulator has support for traffic lights; so influencing the traffic
with traffic lights should be straightforward.</li>
<li>Some easily replaced methods in the micro-simulator. For instance the
car following logic.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Look and feel improvements</h1>
Windows programs are usually littered with colorful icons on buttons, menus,
etc. Some effort is needed to make OpenTraffic <i>look</i> more attractive.
There are many sources of icons on the web that may be used at no charge (some
require attribution of the source). Some examples are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://openclipart.org/">OpenClipArt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iconsdb.com/">Icons DB - free custom icons</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iconfinder.com/">Icon Search Engine | Iconfinder</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iconfinder.com/free_icons">Free icons!</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>What Open Source license shall we use for OpenTraffic?</h1>
A list of common Open Source licenses can be found at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses">Wikipedia.org</a>.
Some often used Open Source licenses (in alphabetical order) are
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD licenses</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License v3</a></li>
</ul>
Virtually all Open Source licenses require attribution of the source of the
software in the form of a notice, or documentation that accompanies the
software and/or some text incorporated in the source code and/or some text that
can be displayed to the user by the program.
<br />
Almost all Open Source licenses require that modifications must be clearly
indicated.
<br />
Almost all Open Source licenses try to protect the publisher of the software 
product from liability for the performance of the software (or lack thereof).
<h2>Apache License, Version 2.0</h2>
As of version 2.0, the Apache license is compatible with GNU GPL v3. The Apache 
license has a clause that terminates the license when the licensee enters into
patent litigation regarding the licensed software.
<h2>BSD licenses</h2>
The are too many BSD license to choose from. Generally, BSD licensed source 
code can be re-used for anything; even products with more restrictive
licenses.
<h2>GNU GPL v3</h2>
The GNU General Public License requires that source code must be made available
to all users of the software. GPL is <i>infective</i> in the sense that all
distributed derivative works must be licensed under the same (or, in some
cases, any later version of the) GPL license.
<h2>Currently preferred option</h2>
GPL
