/**
 * Tactical planners generate operational plans that are in line with reaching the goals of the strategical plan. The modeler is
 * totally free how the tactical planners are generated. Usually there is one tactical planner at work, but it is of course
 * possible to have multiple parallel planners that assess the situation and an overarching tactical planner that acts as a
 * tie-breaker. Alternatively, a single tactical planner is activated depending on the situation. Suppose we drive on a
 * multi-lane stretch of road. The tactical planner can use the headway and lane change algorithms to generate the right
 * operational plans (movements). When the GTU nears a crossing, another tactical planner can be activated that takes care of
 * going left, straight or right (based on a consultation of the strategical plan) and for providing a safe passage of the
 * crossing. After the crossing, the standard headway and lane-change tactical planner take over.<br>
 * The operational plans that the tactical planners generate can have a very different duration. In case of a standard headway
 * and lane change algorithm with a time step of 0.5 seconds, each operational plan can take 0.5 seconds. Alternatively,
 * operational plans can have a very different duration, depending on the situation. When changing lanes, the complete movement
 * to the other lane can be one operational plan. When it is not busy, and the GTU can move for 5 seconds without problems, the
 * operational plan can take 5 seconds. Based on external stimuli (for which the Perception unit of the GTU is responsible),
 * operational plans can always be interrupted.
