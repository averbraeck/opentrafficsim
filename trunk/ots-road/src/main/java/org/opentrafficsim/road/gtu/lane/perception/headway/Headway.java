/**
 * Interface for a reference to information about a (lane based) GTU and a headway. The Headway can store information about GTUs
 * or objects ahead of the reference GTU, behind the reference GTU, or (partially) parallel to the reference GTU. In addition to
 * the (perceived) headway, several other pieces of information can be stored, such as (perceived) speed, (perceived)
 * acceleration, (perceived) turn indicators, and (perceived) braking lights. <br>
 * Special care must be taken in curves when perceiving headway of a GTU or object on an adjacent lane.The question is whether
 * we perceive the parallel or ahead/behind based on a line perpendicular to the front/back of the GTU (rectangular), or
 * perpendicular to the center line of the lane (wedge-shaped in case of a curve). The difficulty of a wedge-shaped situation is
 * that reciprocity might be violated: in case of a clothoid, for instance, it is not sure that the point on the center line
 * when projected from lane 1 to lane 2 is the same as the projection from lane 2 to lane 1. The same holds for shapes with
 * sharp bends. Therefore, algorithms implementing headway should only project the <i>reference point</i> of the reference GTU
 * on the center line of the adjacent lane, and then calculate the forward position and backward position on the adjacent lane
 * based on the reference point. Still, our human perception of what is parallel and what not, is not reflected by fractional
 * positions. See examples in <a href=
 * "http://simulation.tudelft.nl:8085/browse/OTS-113">http://simulation.tudelft.nl:8085/browse/OTS-113</a>.
