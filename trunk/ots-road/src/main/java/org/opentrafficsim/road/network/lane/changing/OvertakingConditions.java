/**
 * This class implements the overtaking conditions. Examples are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Overtaking on the left is allowed for all GTU types (not likely when there are e.g., both cars and bicycles in the
 * model).</li>
 * <li>A GTU type CAR can overtake a GTU type TRACTOR on the left on this road, but no other types of GTUs.</li>
 * <li>When the speed of the GTU you try to overtake is lower than 50 km/h, you can overtake on the left.</li>
 * <li>When the speed of the GTU you try to overtake is 25 km/h less than the maximum speed of the lane on which you and the
 * other GTU are driving, you can overtake on the left or right.</li>
 * <li>only overtake vehicles that have a maximum speed of under 25 km/h.</li>
 * <li>Overtaking on the left is allowed for all GTU types, but overtaking on the right is also allowed when traffic density is
 * below a certain number</li>
 * <li>Overtaking on the left is allowed for all GTU types, but overtaking on the right is also allowed when the distance to a
 * traffic light is less than 200 m</li>
 * <li>Overtaking on the left and the right is allowed for all GTUs. This can e.g. be used on an American highway where all GTUs
 * that are allowed on the highway can indeed overtake on the right or the left.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Note:</b> The class only checks whether it is <b>allowed</b> to overtake another GTU on this road, not whether it is
 * possible or safe to do so. That has to be checked by the GTU itself based on e.g., gap acceptance.
