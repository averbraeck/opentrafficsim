<H2>Integrated Lane Change Model with Relaxation and
	Synchronization (LRMS)</H2>
<p>Wouter J. Schakel, Victor L. Knoop and Bart van Arem</p>
<p>A proposed lane change model can be integrated with a
	car-following model to form a complete microscopic driver model. The
	model resembles traffic better at a macroscopic level, especially
	regarding the amount of traffic volume per lane, the traffic speeds in
	different lanes, and the onset of congestion. In a new approach, lane
	change incentives are combined for determining a lane change desire.
	Included incentives are to follow a route, to gain speed, and to keep
	right. Classification of lane changes is based on behavior that depends
	on the level of lane change desire. Integration with a car-following
	model is achieved by influencing car-following behavior for relaxation
	and synchronization, that is, following vehicles in adjacent lanes.
	Other improvements of the model are trade-offs between lane change
	incentives and the use of anticipation speed for the speed gain
	incentive. Although all these effects are captured, the lane change
	model has only seven parameters. Loop detector data were used to
	validate and calibrate the model, and an accurate representation of
	lane distribution and the onset of congestion was shown.</p>
