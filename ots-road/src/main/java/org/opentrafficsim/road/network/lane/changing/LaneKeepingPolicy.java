/**
 * Enum to indicate the general lane keeping rules: keep left, keep right, or keep lane. When KEEP_RIGHT or KEEP_LEFT is used,
 * the gap acceptance policy of the GTU indicates when the vehicle will move back to the left or right after overtaking. The GTU
 * could decide to stay in a lane and not go back as well; it is a general policy that asks the collaboration of the GTU driver.
