/**
 * Interface that can be implemented by desired headway models and desired speed models, such that they can be coupled to their
 * simulation context. Note that these models need to be able to work without this context, as part of peeking by GTU
 * generators. For instance, they can provide some default or average value. When the GTU is successfully generated, the
 * {@code init()} method is invoked by {@code AbstractCarFollowingModel}, and the model can work fully throughout the GTUs life
 * span thereafter.
